            Breaking News: Sandy Shores Travel Agency has officially declared that
            flip-flops are the new formal wear! After extensive research, we’ve
            found that 9 out of 10 beachgoers prefer a wardrobe that transitions
            seamlessly from beach towel to beachfront restaurant. We’re still
            trying to figure out where the other 10% are going in full suits and
            ties...

            In more groundbreaking news, we’re introducing a new destination:
            Coconut Island! Perfect for those who want a true tropical experience,
            this island is so remote, the Wi-Fi password is still ‘12345.’
            Warning: coconuts may contain traces of paradise and a surprising lack
            of responsibility.

            Our annual “Towel Takedown” contest is back! This year, we’ve upped
            the ante: if you can stake your claim on a pool chair before 8 AM, you
            win eternal bragging rights and the envy of all future vacationers.
            May the best sunbather win—no elbows, please.

            Ever dreamt of working remotely from a hammock? Well, your dream might
            come true if you can type with one hand while balancing a piña colada
            in the other! Our new "Work from Beach" packages offer premium
            hammocks, shady palm trees, and the ocean's soothing soundtrack—just
            don’t blame us when your productivity drops to zero.
