# Build a Multi-page Responsive Website

## Challenge

Using the wireframe you created as your first exercise, develop it into a fully functioning, multi-page website. The website should showcase the following techniques you've learned this week:

1. **Flexbox** for layout structure.
2. **Flexbox alignment** to position elements.
3. At least **one pseudo-element or pseudo-class**.
4. Use of **CSS variables** for consistent styling (e.g., colors, borders).
5. A **contact page** with a styled contact form.

Your site should include multiple pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact) and must be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience building and laying out a real, responsive website.
- Understand how to use **Flexbox** for modern page layouts.
- Learn how to apply **CSS variables** for consistent theming across your website.
- Practice integrating **pseudo-elements or pseudo-classes** for dynamic or decorative styling.
- Learn how to build and style a functional **contact form**.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to create a multi-page, responsive website that uses modern layout techniques like Flexbox, CSS variables, and pseudo-elements so that I can build a flexible, maintainable website that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Structure and Layout:**

   - Use **Flexbox** to structure the layout of your pages.
   - Properly utilize **flexbox alignment** to ensure items are well-positioned within their containers.
   - Ensure the layout is **responsive**, adapting to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

2. **Styling:**
   - Include at least one **pseudo-element or pseudo-class** in your styling (e.g., `:hover`, `:before`, `:after`).
   - Use **CSS variables** for managing consistent color schemes, and optionally for other properties like borders and spacing.
3. **Multi-page Navigation:**

   - Your website should contain more than one page (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
   - Each page should be well-structured and follow a cohesive design.
   - Include a **navigation bar** that links to the different pages.

4. **Contact Page:**
   - Create a **contact form** on the Contact page with styled inputs for name, email, message, and a submit button.
   - Ensure the contact form is styled properly and provides a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
5. **Code Quality:**
   - Use clean, well-commented, and formatted HTML and CSS.
   - Ensure your website is **accessible**, using semantic HTML tags where appropriate (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).

## Example Flow

1. **Step 1**: Start by reviewing the wireframe you created in the first exercise.
2. **Step 2**: Set up your project folder and create multiple HTML pages (e.g., index.html, about.html, contact.html).
3. **Step 3**: Implement your layout using **Flexbox**. Apply flexbox alignment techniques to position elements as needed.
4. **Step 4**: Use **CSS variables** to handle consistent color schemes and optionally other properties like borders and spacing.
5. **Step 5**: Style your contact page with a **contact form** and ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes.
6. **Step 6**: Incorporate **pseudo-elements or pseudo-classes** into your styling for interactive or decorative effects.
7. **Step 7**: Test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it is fully responsive.
